You were having a wonderful time at the beach. Sun. Surf. Small little sand crabs. How did you end up in this situation? The last thing you remember is being thrown you into the ocean and sinking to the bottom until you blacked out. How will you find your way out?

Let Freedom Swim
An Interactive Fiction by Elasia Hamilton
Release 1 / Serial number 140319 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Cave Cell (in Bubble)
 It&apos;s a cold, damp cave currently being used as your holding cell. You&apos;re currently stuck in a bubble. It&apos;s translucent, but for some reason you can&apos;t figure out how to pop the bubble. Also, you see a bored-looking mermaid guard standing outside.Some shells glitter on the floor, giving off the appearance of enchantment. Interestingly, bubble float up from their openings.To the north you see a light, probably leading elsewhere. Or down the hall. Who knows.

You can see a Mermaid Guard here.

Cave Cell
 It&apos;s a cold, damp cave currently being used as your holding cell. Some shells glitter on the floor, giving off the appearance of enchantment. Interestingly, bubble float up from their openings.

You can only hold your breath for so long, and without the bubble of air around you, there&apos;s no air for you to breathe. Your quest to escape fails as water fills your lungs.

Upon seeing you outside of your bubble, she hisses at you, and the fins on her face flair out threateningly, before she throws her trident through your midsection.
